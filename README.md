After getting my ergodox infinity I wasn't that excited with the default images and colors on the LCD screen. I realized modding them by directly manipulating the flashing files was really easy and doesn't require special compilers and such... I also saw people asking for such a software, so I made a quick and simple program that does just that, but after a day and zero downloads from [I:C forums](https://input.club/forums/topic/ied-lcd-editor-v0-9-gui-editor-to-modify-the-lcd) it's obvious no one will find it there, so I'll post about it here as well. Hopefully someone will find it useful.

Next you need the .dfu.bin files from the configurator: https://input.club/configurator-ergodox and drop them in the folder

I haven't been able to test it on other than Windows, but theoretically it might work cross-platform. If something doesn't work I can try to fix it, or upload the source so someone on a different platform can try and port it or add fuctionalities.

Some images:
As you can see I've put Func4 to be backlights off, this way I can easily turn off the lights during the night.
Ironically I haven't yet figured out how to change the default layer led color directly, which was what I originally wanted to do, so you'll be stuck with the default. Everything else works.
